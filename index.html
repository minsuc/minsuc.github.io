My interests lie in quantitative macroeconomics and econometrics. The first two chapters of my dissertation explore how micro-level heterogeneity helps us understand the dynamics of macroeconomic variables. This ranges from estimating a life-cycle model of heterogeneous households with the micro data to including aggregate and cross-section data in linear functional vector autoregressive models. The third chapter is on nonparametric estimation of multivariate densities which can be used to add nonlinearity to the vector autoregressions devised in the second chapter of my dissertation.
